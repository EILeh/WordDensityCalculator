WordDensityCalculator

Program is a word density calculator that reads a piece of text from the user
and then prints how many times each of the words appears in the text. The words
in the list are printed in alphabetic order and all the letters are in
lower-case. A string separated from other strings with empty characters is
considered a word (separated from the text using a split method).
